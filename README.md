# WindowWeasel

Running WPF? Want to borrow another program? BOOM! WINDOW WEASEL!!

Its basically like an iFrame but for programs. It does not work with all (but most) programs.

What I tested to be working:
* Blender
* Maya
* MsPaint
* Krita
* Scrap Mechanic (video game)

Not working:
* Chrome / FireFox
* WindowsSettings
* Explorer.exe
* GIMP
